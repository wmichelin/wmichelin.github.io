        Greetings, my name is Walter Michelin and I'm a Senior Computer Science major at The College of New Jersey. I have been interning with <a class="navItem" href="http://www.infragistics.com">Infragistics</a> since May 2014 in their services department, working on various web applications. <br/><br/>
		Some of the technologies I have worked with are:
        <ul>
            <li>HTML/CSS/Javascript</li>
            <li>JQuery</li>
            <li>Knockout JS</li>
            <li>ASP.NET MVC</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
		In my free time, I enjoy working with node.js and the various libraries available on the node platform.<br/><br/> In my time at The College of New Jersey I have participated in many hackathons, although I would say I used my time at these events learning, instead of competing. I am always looking to sharpen my skills by learning new technologies and design patterns. 
        
        <br/><br/>
        My favorite project in school so far has been in my information retrieval course. I created a full stack search engine in node.js, and this code is available on my <a class="navItem" href="https://github.com/wmichelin">GitHub</a> account. 
        
        <br/><br/>
        This spring I will be conducting mentored research under Dr. Knox and Dr. DePasquale, creating a full stack web application for The College of New Jersey. More information about this project will be made available upon request by contacting me at wmichelin@gmail.com.

        <br/>
		I am 21 years old, and I am from Seattle, Washington. I currently reside in Ewing, New Jersey. I am going to graduate from The College of New Jersey with a degree in Computer Science in December 2015. 
        <br/><br/>
I have been programming since I was 15 years old. I discovered programming at Toms River High School South, during my sophomore year of high school by taking an introductory level computer science course. We started out using Borland C++ and learning the most basic elements of programming. I moved on the AP Computer Science course the following year, which expanded on our knowledge, as well as introduced us to some OOP concepts such as classes, polymorphism, etc. <br/><br/>
        After high school, I wasn't entirely sure what I wanted to do with my life, but I thought it had something to do with business. I attended Ocean County College from 2011 to 2013, where I recieved an associates degree in Business Administration. I transferred to The College of New Jersey, where I found out I wanted to become a software developer.   So far in my time here I have grown immensely as a programmer, although I still have a lot to learn.
